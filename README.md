# Emoji Picker
A quick and easy emoji keyboard for everyone.

This is based on [Ozymandias' emoji keyboard](https://github.com/OzymandiasTheGreat/emoji-keyboard) and pulls together as a cross-platform alternative.

## Running
The main keyboard can be run simply with:
```
git submodule init
git submodule update

python3 main.py
```

Once the submodules have been initialised, a keyboard shortcut to open the picker can  easily be added through most distros with Python 3 targeting `main.py`.
